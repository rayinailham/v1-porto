## Build & Lint Status
✅ **Build Status**: Successful - No errors, only 1 warning about img tag optimization
✅ **Lint Status**: Passed - No errors, only 1 warning about img tag optimization

## Summary
- **Files Removed**: 6 component files + 1 hook file = 7 total files
- **Dependencies Removed**: 3 npm packages
- **Bundle Size Impact**: Reduced by removing unused packages
- **Functionality**: All existing features remain intact
- **Code Quality**: Maintained with successful build and lint checks

## Recommendations
1. Consider replacing the `<img>` tag in `hero-section.tsx` with Next.js `<Image>` component for better optimization
2. Regular cleanup should be performed to prevent accumulation of unused code
3. Consider using tools like `depcheck` to automatically detect unused dependencies in the future
